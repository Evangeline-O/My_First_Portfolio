    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <h3>Things You'll Learn</h3>

    <p>This is my very first webpage using pure HTML. I'm excited to be learning how websites are made from scratch!</p>
    <p>I'm currently learning web development with ALX. It's been both challenging and rewarding.</p>
    <p>With each line of code, I'm getting closer to building real-world applications and websites.</p>
    <p>HTML is the backbone of the web, and I'm happy to be learning the fundamentals properly.</p>
